## Purpose

The purpose of this portfolio functions as a platform for potential employers and peers to get a rundown of who i am, what I have worked on and accomplished, access my resume or get in touch with me. <br> Practically the portfolio exercise had the purpose of introducing me to both writing and styling HTML in a real-world scenario.  As previously stated, the target audience for this project would ideally be potential employers and or collaborators.

## Functionality

The website itself has 4 pages; a landing home page with my immediate contact information, a portfolio page that will contain my works and projects, an about me page where I describe who i am and my experience and a blog page that in entirely placeholder.  I am not sure if I will keep this section on the site after the project is completed unless I can find a good reason to do so.

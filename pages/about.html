            <p class="text">Hi, I'm Vittorio! I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia and I have worn many hats in my lifetime, from working in construction to retail and call centers to contributing to the NBN rollout to the nation. While my roles and work environments have dramatically differed the one thing that has remained a constant has been my curiosity and eagerness to learn new skills. <br><br> I have always had a passion for technology as a internet user; be it gaming, researching or socialising, I am the guy who likes to click the buttons and see what does what. In the gaming world I was always in awe of community modders who would take the base game and turn it into something more, I had SEEN code before and looked at it like a mysterious secret language. <br><br>Learn 2 Code was at one stage a meme to me, but soon the idea planted in my subconcience and I decided I wouldn't let my memes be dreams any longer.  I am now studying with Coder Academy where I endeavour to learn as much as I can and become a full stack developer of the future. I'll still be the guy clicking all the buttons, and definitely the guy making new buttons for others to click too!</p>
